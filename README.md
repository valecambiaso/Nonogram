A nonogram game where the user has the ability to complete a grid based on the hints on its sides in order to find the appropriate solution. They can switch between '#' to fill in the grid and 'X' to identify cells that cannot be painted. Additionally, grids of different sizes are offered, along with a button that allows resetting the board to its original state before starting to play. In addition to attempting to solve the game, the user has the option to access the solution or hints to facilitate the resolution of the Nonogram.

The implementation of the game is divided into two main languages. In Prolog, everything related to building the Nonogram solution was implemented; the search for different possible answers per line, their refinement and analysis, and finally, the combination of them to find the correct solution. In React, everything related to user interaction was implemented, such as buttons and visual additions, as well as various controls and internal additions to promote the correct functioning of the game.
